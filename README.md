# Distributed-QRdecomposition

Autors: Guillermo Benito-Calv√±o, Leon Mengoni, Filippo Pra-Fiorani

Using three virtual machines from CLoud Veneto we manage to implement an algorithm to paralelize a QR decomposition. The main objetives of the project are:
- Create a Cluster from scratch.
- Implement the distributed algorithm using dask.
